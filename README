This program creates multiple threads, which opens the same file
(by creating that file if it does not exist), and does fops such
as read, write, stat, chown on their respective fd. Also some
threads open the directory and keeps doing readdir. A statistics
of how many times a fop is performed is maintained. The program
as of now runs for 10 minutes (600 seconds).

TODO:

Make the time for which the program runs configurable by taking
command line arguments.
